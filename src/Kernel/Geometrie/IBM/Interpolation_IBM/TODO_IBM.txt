* Pre-processing with MEDCoupling should be integrated into the C++ rather than 
having all the MED fields elem_fluid, elem_solid, etc ...
* PDF_model : vitesse param should be split into two opt arg vitesse_med and vitesse_analytic (easier for XDATA)
* Interp_IBM_hybrid should use multiple C++ inheritance
