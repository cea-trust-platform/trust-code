/*! @brief Base class for all input/output streams.
 *
 * Holds information about binary/ascii format, and 32b/64b information.
 *
 *   - bin_ indicates whether the stream is binary or ASCII
 *   - is_64b_ incidates whether the stream is in 64b or 32b
 *   - avoid_conversion_ is used for MPI Comm buffer, where we do not want any int/long conversion.
 *
 * See method must_convert() and file arch.h.in for more explanations on 32/64b.
 *
 * Note that the .sauv files for example are always written in 32b.
 *
 * @sa Entree, Sortie, and specifically the comments in operator_template<>() method.
