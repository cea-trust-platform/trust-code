/*! @brief Whether to convert an int into a long when reading/writing out data.
 *
 * The rules are:
 *   - for 32 files, everything is read/written as 'int', even if _TYPE_ 'long' (or trustIdType) was requested - overflow is checked
 *     in Entree/Sortie classes
 *   - for 64 files, everything is read/written as 'long', even if _TYPE_ 'int' (or trustIdType) was requested
 *     This is for historical reasons: in the former 64b version of TRUST all int were replaced by long, we need to
 *     keep backward compatibility. When we read a former .sauv file written prior to 1.9.5 for example, all integer values are 'long'.
 *     But we might need to load them in an 'int' variable (for example this is the case with the 'format_sauvegarde'
 *     value in Probleme_base).
 *
 * Note however that we can force the file to written in 32b even when running the 64b executable, thanks to the is_64b
 * flag. This is what we do in Problem_base, save/restart logic.
