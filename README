To detect the environment, run:
./configure

A file env/machine.env will be created.
You can then edit this file and some others (env/make.linux*)
to change some default values.

To initialize:
source env_TRUST.sh

To build a binary with a single directory build:
make # Create an optimized debug binaries
make optim # Create an optimized binary 
make debug # Create a debug binary
make prof  # Create a profiled binary  

To check:
make check

To clean (will delete all .o and .a of TRUST sources, inside directories or MonoDir_... directories)
make clean

To clean also the third party libraries:
./configure -clean
