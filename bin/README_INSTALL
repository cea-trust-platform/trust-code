-----------------

1. To install version X.Y.Z of TRUST, create a directory to install TRUST. 
Move into this directory the file TRUST-X.Y.Z.tar (and eventually the

to untar the files (the version before the eventual patch):

$ tar xvf TRUST-X.Y.Z_ARCH.tar
$ tar xvf PatchX.Y.Z.tar

Several files appear and in particular the file you read and
the Intaller_TRUST install script.

2. Run the Installer_TRUST script to install TRUST automatically.

$ ./Installer_TRUST

Several questions may be asked to you, for example, if you want to
re-compile TRUST.

modify the configuration so that it builds properly on your system
