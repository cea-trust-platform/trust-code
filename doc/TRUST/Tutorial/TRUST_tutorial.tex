\frametitle{Visualization during the calculation}
\begin{block}{}

\begin{itemize}

\item Launch the "trust -evol" tool with: \\
\textbf{trust -evol\index{trust -evol} Obstacle \&} \\
This tool allows to launch calculation and visualize results

\item To run the calculation, click on the button "Start computation!".

\item Visualization:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Select "PRESSION(X=0.13,Y=0.105)" in the left list  and click on "Plot" to draw the evolution of the pressure at the probe location.
    \item [$\circ$] Check the velocity profile behind the square cylinder by plotting "VITESSE\_X(X=0.14,Y=0.115)" and "VITESSE\_Y(X=0.14,Y=0.115)".
    \item [$\circ$] Visualize the equation residuals on the same plot, select "$ Ri = max \left| \frac{dV}{dt} \right|$" and "$residu = max \left| Ri \right|$" using the button "Plot on same" or select the two graphs with "Ctrl" button then "plot".
    \end{itemize}

%\item Check the convergence monitoring: plot 0 in the first menu to open the convergence menu, then open the 4 following plots:
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item [$\circ$] Pressure linear system convergence at each time step
%    \item [$\circ$] Residual error $\left\Vert Ax-B \right\Vert$ of the pressure linear system at the last time step
%    \item [$\circ$] Time step evolution
%    \item [$\circ$] Flow rate error evolution
%    \end{itemize}
%Type "5" to quit this menu and return to the first one.
%\vspace{0.1cm}
%\item Open the menu "Surface fluxes characteristics" (plot1), visualize:
 %   \begin{itemize}
 %   \item [$\circ$] the drag exerted by the fluid on the square Cylinder (plot 1, then 4 for the square), close this menu with 7.
%    \item [$\circ$] the "Pressure drag + Friction drag" with 5 and select the Square boundary (4). Each drag is plotted together with the total drag also called viscous drag.

\begin{block}{}

The goal of this exercise is to introduce parallelism in the data file of the previous exercise.

\begin{itemize}
\item Go to the previous study (should be done) and after you had suppressed the \textbf{reprise} keyword and set \textbf{tinit\index{tinit}} to 0 again in the \textit{Obstacle.data} file, create two new files:\\
\textbf{cd Formation\_TRUST/yourname/Obstacle} \\
\textbf{mkdir PARA1} \\
\textbf{cd PARA1} \\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.data DEC\_Obstacle.data} \\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.data PAR\_Obstacle.data} \\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.geo .}\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
\item Edit the first file (\textit{DEC\_Obstacle.data}) to create the partition of the mesh.
\end{itemize}

\end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Parallel calculation}
\begin{block}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item In this file, uncomment the block around the \textbf{Partition} keyword.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Here, the partitioning tool \textbf{Metis\index{Metis}} is used. We cut in \textbf{nb\_parts\index{nb\_parts}} blocks, here in 2.
    \item [$\circ$] The overlapping width \textbf{Larg\_joint\index{Larg\_joint}} between two parts of the partition should be defined according to the numerical scheme higher order, generally the convective scheme. Its value is generally 1 for a second-order scheme, and 2 for third- or fourth-order schemes such as Quick\index{quick} scheme.
    \item [$\circ$] In VEF, you should use \textbf{2} for \textbf{Larg\_joint\index{Larg\_joint}} except when partitioning a domain where only the conduction equation will be solved.
    \item [$\circ$] At least, the keyword \textbf{zones\_name\index{zones\_name}} is useful to define the name of the files containing the partitioned mesh and to write these files.
    \item [$\circ$] Notice the presence of the keyword \textbf{End} in the "Partition" block: the code will stop reading the data file at this line!
    \end{itemize}

\item Run the data file: \textbf{trust DEC\_Obstacle}

\item Check that the partitioned mesh files DOM\_0000.Zones and DOM\_0001.Zones are generated inside your working directory: \textbf{ls *.Zones}

\begin{itemize}
\item Now, edit the file PAR\_Obstacle.data and comment the read of the mesh
(using \# tags of the 'BEGIN/END MESH' comments).

\item Uncomment the \textbf{Scatter} keyword which will read the partitioned mesh. 

%\item Visualize partitioning with:\\
%\textbf{trust -mesh\index{trust -mesh} PAR\_Obstacle}

\item Now, run a parallel calculation with TRUST:\\
\textbf{trust PAR\_Obstacle 2}

\item Post-processing step is identical in sequential or parallel modes. Probes are written into .son files and fields into .lata files. Run VisIt with:\\
\textbf{visit\index{visit} -o PAR\_Obstacle.lata \&}

\item Select the last time step and visualize the blocks (with Plots: Add $\rightarrow$ Subset $\rightarrow$ blocks)
which represent the parts of the domain partition, then the velocity fields. You can
also visualize a field only on a selected part (block) with the menu Control $\rightarrow$ Subset.

\item Visualize probes at the end of the calculation using:\\
\textbf{trust -evol\index{trust -evol} PAR\_Obstacle \&}

%    \begin{itemize} 
%    \item [$\circ$] the file exemple.data and run \textbf{trust -partition}. But it will \underline{erase} the DEC\_exemple.data, SEQ\_exemple.data and PAR\_exemple.data files and create new zones. Then it will run the new DEC\_exemple.data file which gives your new ***.Zones files \underline{or},

\item This test case deals with a 3D two-phase flow in a tank with one initial interface between liquid and gas, a droplet, and a rotating solid in the liquid. The Discontinuous Front Tracking method is used with a 3D structured mesh.

    \item [$\circ$] the type of the problem: \textbf{Probleme\_FT\_disc\_gen\index{Probleme\_FT\_disc\_gen}} in the data file. This refers to the Discontinuous Front Tracking method.
    \item [$\circ$] the keyword \textbf{modele\_turbulence\index{modele\_turbulence}}. Navier-Stokes equations of the Discontinuous Front Tracking problem needs the read of this keyword even if the flow is laminar.

\item Increase the height of the tank (from 0.06 to 0.12).

\item Add a second drop above the first one, at $z=0.08$ (keywords \textbf{ajout\_phase0\index{ajout\_phase0}} could be useful to add other interfaces, cf Reference Manual for \textbf{ajout\_phase0/ajout\_phase1\index{ajout\_phase1}} keywords). It is possible to access to the reference manual by typing \textbf{triocfd -index\index{triocfd -index}}. Don't forget the comma between the two definition of the drops.

\item Change the \textbf{dt\_post\index{dt\_post}} period of the 3 post-processing blocks (0.05 to 0.01). The first one (add \textbf{format lata\index{format lata}}) is the classical block for post-processing probes and fields. Here, we want to see the concentration field and the \textbf{"indicatrice\_interf"} field. Value of this field is 0 for liquid and 1 for gas, so the interface is located at "indicatrice" value 0.5.

\item Change the interpolation location of \textbf{indicatrice\_interf\index{indicatrice\_interf}} and the \textbf{concentration} fields in the first post-processing block, by adding the keyword \textbf{elem} just after the fields: the values in the post-processing tool will be plotted at the center of each element of the mesh.

\begin{itemize}
\item The second post-processing block is the new syntax to post-process interfaces moving meshes. You can visualize it with \textbf{VisIt}. 

\item On each interface, you can plot several fields i.e.: curvature with \textbf{courbure} keyword and velocity interface with \textbf{vitesse} keyword, \textbf{pe} field is for debugging purpose, it is useless here, you can suppress it) on several locations (on nodes with \textbf{sommets} keyword, on cells with \textbf{elements} keyword).

\item Run the calculation. Follow the time step evolution by having a look at the \textbf{dt\_ev} file. It contains on each line the physical time, the time step, security factor and residuals.

\item Post-process to visualize the interface and the concentration field.

\item You can increase the number of cells to have a finest simulation or also change to VEF discretization.

\frametitle{Salom\'e: Create domains for a TRUST coupled problem\label{salomecoupledpb}}
\begin{block}{}
Consider that we want to simulate a coupled problem with TRUST on a complex geometry. Suppose that this latter is drawn by means of Salom\'e.

The main difficulty araises from the fact that the mesh elements should be connected on the interface between the two domains in order to be correctly read by TRUST. \\
%
In this exercise, you will learn how to:
\begin{itemize}
\item  Create two domains (domain 1 and domain 2) using Salom\'e
\item  Get a coherent mesh on the interface between the two domains. We recall that TRUST is able to treat only meshes with connected elements on the interface.
\item  Mesh both domains and export it into a single MED file.
\item  Read the MED file from TRUST datafile and simulate a coupled problem.
\end{itemize}
%
Note: for simple geometries, the internal TRUST mesher "Mailler" will be largely sufficient (see the exercise \ref{docond_pb_couple} for example).

Let us consider the cooling of a solid block by means of a fluid flowing inside circular cross-section channels. The channel is centered in the block of a square cross-section. The outer boundaries of the solid are adiabatic. Below is given a schematic description of the problem.

\begin{figure}

In order to build meshes using Salom\'e for such a simulation, we should create two domains: the first domain will represent the solid block and the second domain the fluid.

\begin{block}{}
Consider you already created a mesh using Salome. You will be able to change mesh and geometry parameters without starting it from scratch if you saved your study in python script.
\newline

Salome offers the possibility to save all commands launched from the Graphical User Interface, either in HDF5 format, or to save the study as a python script. 
If you dump your study in a python script, you can later modify some parameters and run it to build the new mesh, without having to rebuild the geometry nor the mesh in Salome.
\newline

In this exercice, you will learn how to do so.

\begin{block}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item You can use the "Optimize 3D" algorithm to optimize your mesh.

\item Export your mesh to a MED file. Run gmsh again on this exported MED file to check everything is defined:\\
\textbf{gmsh file.med \&}

\item Now, use your mesh in a TRUST calculation, for example:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item [$\circ$] copy the data file of the first exercise into a Obstacle\_VEF.data file, \\
        \item [$\circ$] read the MED file:\\
                        \textbf{Read\_MED \{ domain dom file file.med \} } \\
                        Notice that by default with Gmsh, the mesh name is the name of the file!
        \item [$\circ$] change the discretization type,
        \item [$\circ$] be careful to the choice of the convection scheme for your VEF calculation,
        \item [$\circ$] and run the simulation on the unstructured mesh.

The prefered route to build a validation form in TRUST and its baltiks is to build a Jupyter notebook. \\
\vspace{0.5cm}

See an example of notebook in \\
\small{\$TRUST\_ROOT/Validation/Rapports\_automatiques/Verification/SampleFormJupyter/} \\
or run on terminal:\\
Run\_fiche -doc
\end{block}

\begin{block}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item First copy the validation form named Source\_canal\_perio:\\
{\small{
\textbf{mkdir -p Formation\_TRUST/yourname/validation} \\
\textbf{cd  Formation\_TRUST/yourname/validation} \\
\textbf{VERIF=\$TRUST\_ROOT/Validation/Rapports\_automatiques/Verification} \\
\textbf{cp -r \$VERIF/Verification\_codage/Source\_canal\_perio \, .} \\
\textbf{cd Source\_canal\_perio}
 }}\\

\item Display Run\_fiche script options:\\
\textbf{Run\_fiche -help\index{Run\_fiche -help}}

\item Build the PDF report with:\\
\textbf{Run\_fiche -export\_pdf}\\
then, open the report with:\\
\textbf{evince build/rapport.pdf}

\begin{itemize}
\item Now, we are going to change the validation form (Examples are given in SampleFormJupyter Validation form):\\
\textbf{Run\_fiche \&}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Add the mesh plot in the report. For this, at end of the notebook, add a new Markdown cell for a title:\\
    \textbf{\#\#Additional information\\
    \#\#\#Mesh visualization } \\
    \item Add a new code cell to plot mesh \\
    \small{fig=visit.Show("./std.lata", "Mesh", "dom", plotmesh=True,title="Mesh")}\\
    \small{fig.plot()}

\begin{itemize}
\item Add the evolution of residuals in the report in log scale (see .dt\_ev file). For this, introduce a new Jupyter text cell and write:\\
\textbf{\#\# Residual plot}\\
then, on another cell plot residual using:\\
\textbf{Graph = plot.Graph("Residual plot")} \\
\textbf{Graph.addResidu("std.dt\_ev",label="Residu")} \\
\textbf{Graph.scale(yscale='log')}

\begin{itemize}
\item Now, we are going to extract the number of cells and the simulation final time from three .err files and write it in .dat files. Extraction script (extraction.sh) is already available in the src directory of this validation form (you can have a look at it). 

    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] from your validation form, run this script using "executeScript" from run module of trustutils (see SampleFormJupyter for help). 

    \item [$\circ$] Add a table to display the results of .dat files: complete the chapter "Additional information" by introducing new cells.\\
    Tip: look on the next slide for an example of table plot.

\begin{itemize}
\item Now we are going to add a fourth test case: "debit4"
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] "debit4" corresponds to "std" test case with zero initial velocity and imposed flow rate to $2 m^3/s$ on "periox" boundary.
    \item [$\circ$] Add the test case using "substitute" and "addCase"
    \end{itemize}

\item We are going to rerun the validation form.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Re-build the whole validation form by clicking on the icone corresponding to the \"restart of the Jupyter kernel and run of the whole notebook\":

    \item [$\circ$] build the pdf report using: \\

    \textbf{Run\_fiche\index{Run\_fiche} -export\_pdf}
    \item [$\circ$] NB: You can add the results of this test case to your "visualization" and to the "table".
