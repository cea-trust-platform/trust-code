\begin{itemize}
\item First, initialize the TRUST environment. On CEA Saclay PCs, TRUST versions are available with (e.g. X.Y.Z=1.7.1):\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{source  /home/triou/env\_TRUST\_X.Y.Z\_patch.sh}
\vspace{0.5cm}

\item Second, several editors (vi, emacs, nedit) are configured to highlight TRUST keywords in the data files. If you prefer using \textbf{nedit}, please do the following:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Run \textbf{nedit}, and select Preferences $\rightarrow$ Save Defaults.
    \item [$\circ$] Then re-initialize the TRUST environment (cf first point), the message "nedit.rc updated" should appear.

\frametitle{Parallel calculation: method 1}
\begin{block}{}

The goal of this exercise is to introduce parallelism in the data file of the previous exercise.

\begin{itemize}
\item Go to the previous study (should be done) and after you had suppressed the \textbf{reprise} keyword and set \textbf{tinit\index{tinit}} to 0 again in the \textit{Obstacle.data} file, create the two new files:\\
\textbf{cd $\sim$/test/yourname/Obstacle} \\
\textbf{mkdir PARA1} \\
\textbf{cd PARA1} \\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.data DEC\_Obstacle.data} \\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.data PAR\_Obstacle.data} \\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.geo .}\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
\item Edit the first file (\textit{DEC\_Obstacle.data}) to create the partition of the mesh.
\end{itemize}

\end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Parallel calculation: method 1}
\begin{block}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item In this file, uncomment the block around the \textbf{Partition} keyword.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Here, the partitioning tool \textbf{Tranche\index{Tranche}} is used. We cut in 2 bands according to X axis and 1 band according to Y axis. 
    \item [$\circ$] The overlapping width \textbf{Larg\_joint\index{Larg\_joint}} between two parts of the partition should be defined according to the numerical scheme higher order, generally the convective scheme. Its value is generally 1 for the two order scheme, and 2 for the three or four-order scheme like Quick\index{quick} scheme.
    \item [$\circ$] In VEF, you should use \textbf{2} for \textbf{Larg\_joint\index{Larg\_joint}} except when partitioning a domain where only the conduction equation will be solved.
    \item [$\circ$] At least, the keyword \textbf{Nom\_Zones\index{Nom\_Zones}} is useful to define the name of the files containing the partitioned mesh and to write these files.
    \item [$\circ$] Notice the presence of the keyword \textbf{End} in the "Partition" block: the code will stop to read the dta file at this point!
    \end{itemize}

\item Run the data file: \textbf{trust DEC\_Obstacle}

\item Check the partitioned mesh files DOM\_0000.Zones and DOM\_0001.Zones are generated in your directory: \textbf{ls *.Zones}
\end{itemize}

\end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Parallel calculation: method 1}
\begin{block}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item Now, edit the file PAR\_Obstacle.data and comment the read of the mesh
(\textbf{Read\_file}) and uncomment the \textbf{Scatter} keyword which will read the partitioned
mesh. Visualize it with VisIt:\\
\textbf{trust -mesh\index{trust -mesh} PAR\_Obstacle}

\item Now, run a parallel calculation with TRUST:\\
\textbf{trust PAR\_Obstacle 2}

\item The post-processing task is identical in sequential or parallel mode. You have the
probes into the .son files and the whole fields in the .lata files. To run VisIt with the
command line:\\
\textbf{visit\index{visit} -o PAR\_Obstacle.lata \&}

\item Select the last time step and visualize the blocks (with Plots: Add $\rightarrow$ Subset $\rightarrow$ blocks)
which represent the parts of the domain partition, then the velocity fields. You can
also visualize a field only on a selected part (block) with the menu Control $\rightarrow$ Subset.

\item To visualize probes after the end of the calculation, you can run the command line:\\
\textbf{trust -probes\index{trust -probes} PAR\_Obstacle}
\end{itemize}

\end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Parallel calculation: method 2}
\begin{block}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item The existing tool \textbf{make\_PAR.data\index{make\_PAR.data}} is useful on the data files \underline{which have} the marks MAILLAGE/MESH, DECOUPAGE/PARTITION and LECTURE/SCATTER. If you run the following commands: \\
\textbf{cd $\sim$/test/yourname/Obstacle} \\
\textbf{mkdir PARA2} \\
\textbf{cd PARA2} \\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.data exemple.data}\\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.geo .}\\
\textbf{make\_PAR.data\index{make\_PAR.data} exemple 3}\\
\textbf{ls *.data *.Zones}\\

\item It will create a DEC\_exemple.data file and will immediately run this file to create a partition with 3 sub zones. The command make\_PAR.data will also create PAR\_exemple.data file and then you will run the calculation by the usual command:\\
\textbf{trust PAR\_exemple 3}

    \item [$\circ$] or use the \textbf{VerifierCoin\index{VerifierCoin}} keyword. For this, after this first error you must find a "diagonale\_VEF.decoupage\_som" file in your directory, so you can use it by adding:\\
    \textbf{VerifierCoin dom \{ lire\_fichier diagonale\_VEF.decoupage\_som \} }\\
    just after "trianguler\index{trianguler} dom". This will subdivides inconsistent 2D/3D cells used with VEFPreP1B\index{VEFPreP1B} discretization (cf User's Manual).

\item \label{read_mesh} Now build a data file named dom.data for TRUST:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline 
\textbf{dimension 3 }\tabularnewline
\textbf{domaine dom }\tabularnewline
\textbf{Lire\_med family\_names\_from\_group\_names dom Mesh\_1 Mesh\_1.med }\tabularnewline
\textbf{Discretiser\_domaine\index{discretiser\_domaine} dom }\tabularnewline
\textbf{Postraiter\_domaine\index{Postraiter\_domaine} \{ domaine dom fichier mesh format lata\index{format lata}
\}}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}

\item Run the data file and post process the mesh with VisIt:\\
\textbf{source  /home/triou/env\_TRUST\_X.Y.Z\_patch.sh} \\
\textbf{trust dom} \\
\textbf{visit\index{visit} -o mesh.lata} \\
\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Warning}: The more common error is to forget to define the boundaries with the groups for the mesh. The error in TRUST is printed and detected during the discretization where all the faces of the mesh (in particular the boundary faces) are built.

\item Name it "Obstacle", set the values of (AC) and (BC) with C the center of the cylinder so (AC, BC) are the coordinates of C in the plan xOy, so $AC=xomin+(xomax-xomin)/10$ and $BC=yomin+(yomax-yomin)/2$.
\item Set the Radius to "radius".
\item Set $CMIN=zomin$ and $CMAX=zomax$, $CMAX-CMIN$ correspond to the cylinder width.
\item Set IDIR to $3$, the cylinder axe and INDMAT to $-9000$ (to make a hole) then "Ok".

\item Close VisIt, and click on "Modeling run..." and then "Pre-mesh visualization".
\item Note that a cell is composed of a matter if its barycenter is in this matter's zone.
\item Close VisIt, click on "Pre-processing run...", you can see the names of the boundaries in function of the indexes that we gave. For exemple, the boundary number 4 is made of the boundaries "Wall", "Wall", Bottom" and "Top" and it's TRUST name will be "Wall\_Wall\_Bottom\_Top".
\item You can change the names of theses boundaries, to have the name you want.
\item To give a name to a boundary is not mandatory for the boundaries with the same matter inder. You have just to name almost one of it.

\begin{block}{Second exercise}

In this exercise, you will learn how to create a 2D mesh with Xprepro. 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{PICTURES/xprepro.pdf}
%\caption{Obstacle}
\end{figure}

The radius of the cylinders is 0.2m and the distances between cylinders are 0.2m in the y direction and 0.6m in the x direction. \\
%You will have a look at the "virus" example (button Examples) to see how to build a loop in the viewlist.

\begin{itemize}
\item Create a directory: Run Xprepro in the TRUST environment:\\
\textbf{mkdir \, -p \, $\sim$/test/yourname/Xprepro/exo2} \\
\textbf{cd \, $\sim$/test/yourname/Xprepro/exo2} \\
\textbf{source /home/triou/env\_TRUST\_X\_Y\_Z(\_patch).sh }\\

\begin{itemize}
\item First, have a look at the "Examples..." ("Picture" button and if you are interested by one "Copy and Read" button).
%\item First, have a look at the Examples (Copy and Read button on virus example) to understand how you will use fortran code in the viewlist to create loops for building your cylinders.

\item Then, click on the button "Default" to define the initial block and edit the dimensions file. 
\item Note that the files "maillagedefaut" and "defaut.prep" are saved in your directory (with "save" in nedit for "maillagedefaut" and "Save file prepro" in Xprepro for defaut.prep).

\item It is a 2D geometry, so we will define:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] xomin=0.,
    \item [$\circ$] xomax=10.,
    \item [$\circ$] yomin=0.,
    \item [$\circ$] yomax=2.,
    \item [$\circ$] zomin=0.,
    \item [$\circ$] zomax=0.01.,
    \item [$\circ$] eps=0.0001 (tolerance) and
    \item [$\circ$] radius=0.2 (don't forget to declare it).
    \end{itemize}
\item Save the file.

\begin{itemize}
\item Click "Modify" on the viewlist to modify the nodes number NX=203, NY=43, NZ=4.
\item Set the matter index to 1000, line 5.
\item Build the boundary blocks:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] line 7, change the "back boundary" name to \textbf{lateral}, INDMAT=$0$,
    \item [$\circ$] line 8, change the "front boundary" name to \textbf{""}, INDMAT=$0$,
    \item [$\circ$] line 9, change the "left boundary" name to \textbf{inlet}, INDMAT=$-1000$,
    \item [$\circ$] line 10, change the "right boundary" name to \textbf{outlet}, INDMAT=$-2000$,
    \item [$\circ$] line 11, change the "bottom boundary" name to \textbf{""}, INDMAT=$0$,
    \item [$\circ$] line 12, change the "top boundary" name to \textbf{""}, INDMAT=$0$.
    \end{itemize}

\item The coordinates of the centre of the first cylinder, which after will be duplicated, are (x0, y0)=(0.6, 0.4). So the distance between to cylinder center is $dx=0.8$ and $dy=0.3$. Declare and initialise this parameters $(x0, y0, dx, dy)$ in your "maillagedefaut" file.

\item Think about how to create 2 Fortran nesteed loops to copy the first cylinder in the two directions X and Y.

\item Create them with the button "Add", select "(fortran code)" instead of "?$\square$" and write your loops in fortran.
\item Check the other objects in the viewlist and save your work with the button "Save file" prepro then check the name of the boundaries with "Boundaries informations".
\item Run the model with "Modeling run...". A window is opened where you will check the nodes coordinates of the mesh.
\item Click on "Pre-mesh visualization" to check your pre-mesh.

\item Create a 2D cut slice in the XY plane: with "Add" button, choose an object of "Meshing creation 2D" type and name it coupe\_2D. Set $POS=0$, $IDIR=3$, $INDMAT=-5000$.
\item Click "Modeling run..." then "Pre-mesh visualization".
\item Warning, it is always a 3D model in Xprepro, even if you wish a 2D mesh. By default, you see the indexes between 1000 and -3000. If you don't see the cylinders, create a 2D slice in the XY plane in VisIt to see inside the 3D pre-mesh.
