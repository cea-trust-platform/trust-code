\begin{block}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item First, initialize the TRUST environment. 
\begin{itemize}
\item On CEA Saclay PCs and callisto cluster, TRUST versions are available with (e.g. X.Y.Z=1.7.6):\\
%\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{source  /home/triou/env\_TRUST\_X.Y.Z.sh}
%\vspace{0.5cm}
\item On your own computer, download and install the latest version of TRUST in your local folder \$MyPathToTRUSTversion (unless this was already performed), then write on the terminal:\\
%\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{source  \$MyPathToTRUSTversion/env\_TRUST\_X.Y.Z.sh}
%\vspace{0.5cm}
\end{itemize}

\item Second, several editors (\textbf{vim}, \textbf{emacs}, \textbf{nedit}, \textbf{gedit}) can be configured to highlight TRUST keywords in the data files. If you prefer using \textbf{nedit}, please do the following:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Run \textbf{nedit}, and select Preferences $\rightarrow$ Save Defaults.
    \item [$\circ$] Then run \textbf{trust -config\index{trust -config} nedit}, the message "nedit.rc updated" should appear.

\begin{itemize}
\item Edit the data file Obstacle.data and set the time step to 0.004s:\\
\textbf{nedit Obstacle.data \&}\\

\item Add to the post-processing block of Obstacle.data the following elements:\\

    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] A pressure probes segment (22 probes between points (0.01, 0.12) and (0.91, 0.12)).
    \vspace{0.1cm}

    \vspace{0.1cm}

    \item [$\circ$] Add the vorticity to the fields being post-processed and change the saving period to 0.5s. To find the appropriate keyword for this field, you can open the Generic Guide with:\\
    \textbf{trust -doc \&\index{trust -doc \&}}
    \vspace{0.1cm}

    \item [$\circ$] Replace the keyword "\textbf{format lml}" with "\textbf{format lata\index{format lata}}" inside the block, just before the keyword \textbf{fields} in order to use the post-processing tool VisIt during and/or after the calculation.

\frametitle{Visualization during the calculation}
\begin{block}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item [$\rightarrow$] You have access to useful resources in the \$TRUST\_ROOT/index.html file with your favorite browser (e.g.: firefox). Take few minutes to find test case examples containing a particular keyword using the \underline{Keywords} link: \\
\textbf{firefox \$TRUST\_ROOT/index.html \&} 
or \textbf{trust -index \&\index{trust -index}}\\

\item Launch the "PLOT2D" tool with: \\
\textbf{trust -evol\index{trust -evol} Obstacle \&} \\
This tool allows to launch calculation and visualize results

\item To run the calculation, click on the button "Start computation!" at the lower left corner of the window.

\item Visualization:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Select "PRESSION(X=0.13,Y=0.105)" in the left list  and click on "Plot" to draw the evolution of the pressure at the probe location.
    \item [$\circ$] Check the velocity profile behind the square cylinder by plotting "VITESSE\_X(X=0.14,Y=0.115)" and "VITESSE\_Y(X=0.14,Y=0.115)".
    \item [$\circ$] Visualize the equation residuals on the same plot, select "$ Ri = max \left| \frac{dV}{dt} \right|$" and "$residu = max \left| Ri \right|$" using the button "Plot on same" or select the two graphs with "Ctrl" button and "plot".
    \end{itemize}

%\item Check the convergence monitoring: plot 0 in the first menu to open the convergence menu, then open the 4 following plots:
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item [$\circ$] Pressure linear system convergence at each time step
%    \item [$\circ$] Residual error $\left\Vert Ax-B \right\Vert$ of the pressure linear system at the last time step
%    \item [$\circ$] Time step evolution
%    \item [$\circ$] Flow rate error evolution
%    \end{itemize}
%Type "5" to quit this menu and return to the first one.
%\vspace{0.1cm}
%\item Open the menu "Surface fluxes characteristics" (plot1), visualize:
 %   \begin{itemize}
 %   \item [$\circ$] the drag exerted by the fluid on the square Cylinder (plot 1, then 4 for the square), close this menu with 7.
%    \item [$\circ$] the "Pressure drag + Friction drag" with 5 and select the Square boundary (4). Each drag is plotted together with the total drag also called viscous drag.

or using "PLOT2D" tool: \textbf{trust -evol\index{trust -evol} Obstacle \&} and click on "Visualisation" on the right menu.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] First, we are going to configure VisIt: {\footnotesize{In the menu File $\rightarrow$ Open file, select Off instead of Smart for File grouping option. For the Filter, specify *.lata to list only the lata files (results). Then save your choices, in the menu Options $\rightarrow$ Save Settings.}}

    \item [$\circ$] In the menu File $\rightarrow$ Open file, select the Obstacle.lata file.

    \item [$\circ$] Visualize the mesh in the "Plots" area with "Add $\rightarrow$ Mesh $\rightarrow$ dom" then click on the button "Draw". Zoom and move the mesh in the right window. You can un-zoom with right button (View $\rightarrow$ Reset view) or with a combination of "Ctrl" keypad and left button.

    \item [$\circ$] Visualize the pressure field ({\footnotesize{Plots area: "Add $\rightarrow$ Pseudocolor $\rightarrow$ PRESSION\_SOM\_dom" + Draw then select the last time on the Time slider}})
    \item [$\circ$] Suppress or hide the mesh (Select Mesh then click on Delete or Hide/Show).

\frametitle{Parallel calculation: 1st method}
\begin{block}{}

The goal of this exercise is to introduce parallelism in the data file of the previous exercise.

\begin{itemize}
\item Go to the previous study (should be done) and after you had suppressed the \textbf{reprise} keyword and set \textbf{tinit\index{tinit}} to 0 again in the \textit{Obstacle.data} file, create two new files:\\
\textbf{cd Formation\_TRUST/yourname/Obstacle} \\
\textbf{mkdir PARA1} \\
\textbf{cd PARA1} \\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.data DEC\_Obstacle.data} \\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.data PAR\_Obstacle.data} \\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.geo .}\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
\item Edit the first file (\textit{DEC\_Obstacle.data}) to create the partition of the mesh.
\end{itemize}

\end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Parallel calculation: 1st method}
\begin{block}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item In this file, uncomment the block around the \textbf{Partition} keyword.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Here, the partitioning tool \textbf{Metis\index{Metis}} is used. We cut in \textbf{nb\_parts\index{nb\_parts}} blocks, here in 2.
    \item [$\circ$] The overlapping width \textbf{Larg\_joint\index{Larg\_joint}} between two parts of the partition should be defined according to the numerical scheme higher order, generally the convective scheme. Its value is generally 1 for a second-order scheme, and 2 for third- or fourth-order schemes such as Quick\index{quick} scheme.
    \item [$\circ$] In VEF, you should use \textbf{2} for \textbf{Larg\_joint\index{Larg\_joint}} except when partitioning a domain where only the conduction equation will be solved.
    \item [$\circ$] At least, the keyword \textbf{zones\_name\index{zones\_name}} is useful to define the name of the files containing the partitioned mesh and to write these files.
    \item [$\circ$] Notice the presence of the keyword \textbf{End} in the "Partition" block: the code will stop reading the data file at this line!
    \end{itemize}

\item Run the data file: \textbf{trust DEC\_Obstacle}

\item Check that the partitioned mesh files DOM\_0000.Zones and DOM\_0001.Zones are generated inside your working directory: \textbf{ls *.Zones}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Now, edit the file PAR\_Obstacle.data and comment the read of the mesh
(using \# tags of the 'BEGIN/END MESH' comments).

\item Uncomment the \textbf{Scatter} keyword which will read the partitioned mesh. 

\item Visualize it with VisIt:\\
\textbf{trust -mesh\index{trust -mesh} PAR\_Obstacle}

\item Now, run a parallel calculation with TRUST:\\
\textbf{trust PAR\_Obstacle 2}

\item The post-processing step is identical in sequential or parallel mode. You have the
probes into the .son files and the whole fields in the .lata files. To run VisIt with the
command line:\\
\textbf{visit\index{visit} -o PAR\_Obstacle.lata \&}

\item Select the last time step and visualize the blocks (with Plots: Add $\rightarrow$ Subset $\rightarrow$ blocks)
which represent the parts of the domain partition, then the velocity fields. You can
also visualize a field only on a selected part (block) with the menu Control $\rightarrow$ Subset.

\item To visualize probes after the end of the calculation, you can run the command line:\\
\textbf{trust -evol\index{trust -evol} PAR\_Obstacle \&}

\item The existing tool \textbf{trust -partition\index{trust -partition}} is useful on the data files \underline{which have} the marks MAILLAGE/MESH, DECOUPAGE/PARTITION and LECTURE/SCATTER. If you run the following commands: \\
\vspace{0.2cm}

\item First we will create a new working directory with our data files:\\
\textbf{cd Formation\_TRUST/yourname/Obstacle} \\
\textbf{mkdir PARA2} \\
\textbf{cd PARA2} \\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.data exemple.data}\\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.geo .}\\

\begin{itemize}
\item It creates:
    \begin{itemize} 
    \item [$\circ$] a \underline{SEQ\_exemple.data} file which is a copy of the sequential data file exemple.data,
    \item [$\circ$] a \underline{DEC\_exemple.data} file which is the first data file to be run. It is immediately run by the command line \textbf{trust -partition} to create a partition (with 3 sub zones here), located in the ***.Zones files. \\
    \textbf{ls *.Zones}\\
    Note that the TRUST code stops reading this file at the keyword "End" just before the "\# END PARTITION \#" block.
    \item [$\circ$] a \underline{PAR\_exemple.data} file which is the data file for the parallel calculation. It uses the ***.Zones files to read the mesh through the line "Scatter DOM.Zones dom". Note that the meshing and cut of the mesh are commented here.

    \end{itemize}

\item For the first one, you can modify:
    \begin{itemize} 
    \item [$\circ$] the file exemple.data and run \textbf{trust -partition}. But it will \underline{erase} the DEC\_exemple.data, SEQ\_exemple.data and PAR\_exemple.data files and create new zones. Then it will run the new DEC\_exemple.data file which gives your new ***.Zones files \underline{or},
    \item [$\circ$] the meshing part of file DEC\_exemple.data and run it with:\\
    \textbf{trust DEC\_exemple.data} \\

In addition, submission files and procedure depend on the cluster itself and could be different from those presented below.
\begin{itemize}
\item Log on to the CEA cluster callisto and initialize the TRUST environment: \\
{\small{
\textbf{ssh -X yourlogin@callisto-login1(.intra.cea.fr)} \\
\textbf{source /panfs/ixion/home/triou/TRUST/TRUST-X.Y.Z/env\_TRUST.sh}\\
or 
\textbf{source /home/triou/env\_TRUST\_X.Y.Z.sh}\\

\item Copy the study Obstacle:\\
\textbf{cd /panfs/ixion/home/yourlogin}\\
\textbf{mkdir  -p  Formation\_TRUST/yourname} \\
\textbf{cd Formation\_TRUST/yourname} \\
\textbf{trust -copy\index{trust -copy} Obstacle} \\

\item Check the state of the job with: \textbf{"squeue"} or \textbf{"squeue -u yourlogin"}

\item You could run VisIt from the cluster but it is not recommended.

\item So you can run VisIt on your PC and access/visualize the result file on callisto cluster.
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Open your .bashrc file (or create it if needed).

\item We want to add a source of constituent's diffusion so copy the \textbf{Constituants\index{Constituants}} study which will give you examples for constituents keyword used for a 2D incompressible laminar flow.

\item Edit your data file in the Marche directory. First, rename the problem in order to add concentration equations (look for the adequate keywords in the Reference Manual).

\item Add 3 constituents of equal diffusivities ($\alpha=1m/s$) and associate the constituents to the problem.

\item Define the concentration equation into the problem (remember that concentrations will be a vector of 3 components) with correct initial ($C_1=0, C_2=0, C_3=0$) and boundary conditions.

\item Use the Schmidt model to close the turbulence model in the concentration equation.

\item Change the sources of the Navier-Stokes turbulence model to a \textbf{Source\_Transport\_K\_Eps\_aniso\_concen\index{Source\_Transport\_K\_Eps\_aniso\_concen} \{ C1\_eps 1.44 C2\_eps 1.92 C3\_eps 1. \} } to fit with the new concentration equation.

\item Increase the height of the tank (from 0.06 to 0.12).

\item Add a second drop above the first one, at $z=0.08$ (keywords \textbf{ajout\_phase0\index{ajout\_phase0}} could be useful to add other interfaces, cf Reference Manual for \textbf{ajout\_phase0/ajout\_phase1\index{ajout\_phase1}} keywords). Don't forget the comma between the two definition of the drops.

\item Change the \textbf{dt\_post\index{dt\_post}} period of the 3 post-processing blocks (0.05 to 0.01). The first one (add \textbf{format lata\index{format lata}}) is the classical block for post-processing probes and fields. Here, we want to see the concentration field and the \textbf{"indicatrice\_interf"} field. Value of this field is 0 for liquid and 1 for gas, so the interface is located at "indicatrice" value 0.5.

\item Change the interpolation location of \textbf{indicatrice\_interf\index{indicatrice\_interf}} and the \textbf{concentration} fields in the first post-processing block, by adding the keyword \textbf{elem} just after the fields: the values in the post-processing tool will be plotted at the center of each element of the mesh.

\begin{itemize}
\item The second post-processing block is the new syntax to post-process interfaces moving meshes. You can visualize it with \textbf{VisIt}. 

\item On each interface, you can plot several fields i.e.: curvature with \textbf{courbure} keyword and velocity interface with \textbf{vitesse} keyword, \textbf{pe} field is for debugging purpose, it is useless here, you can suppress it) on several locations (on nodes with \textbf{sommets} keyword, on cells with \textbf{elements} keyword).

\item Run the calculation. Follow the time step evolution by having a look at the \textbf{dt\_ev} file. It contains on each line the physical time, the time step, security factor and residuals.

\item Post-process to visualize the interface and the concentration field.

\item You can increase the number of cells to have a finest simulation or also change to VEF discretization.

\frametitle{Salom\'e: Create domains for a TRUST coupled problem}
\begin{block}{}
Consider that we want to simulate a coupled problem with TRUST on a complex geometry. Suppose that this latter is drawn by means of Salom\'e.

The main difficulty araises from the fact that the mesh elements should be connected on the interface between the two domains in order to be correctly read by TRUST. \\
%
In this exercise, you will learn how to:
\begin{itemize}
\item  Create two domains (domain 1 and domain 2) using Salom\'e
\item  Get a coherent mesh on the interface between the two domains. We recall that TRUST is able to treat only meshes with connected elements on the interface.
\item  Mesh both domains and export it into a single MED file.
\item  Read the MED file from TRUST datafile and simulate a coupled problem.
\end{itemize}
%
Note: for simple geometries, the internal TRUST mesher "Mailler" will be largely sufficient (see the exercise \ref{docond_pb_couple} for example).

Let us consider the cooling of a solid block by means of a fluid flowing inside circular cross-section channels. The channel is centered in the block of a square cross-section. The outer boundaries of the solid are adiabatic. Below is given a schematic description of the problem.
%
\begin{figure}

In order to build meshes using Salom\'e for such a simulation, we should create two domains: the first domain will represent the solid block and the second domain the fluid.

\item Click on "Default" button to begin from a cube. Read the pop-up window and click on "Ok". A new nedit window appears, opening a file named "maillagedefaut" in which we will set the values of the parameters used in our geometry.
\item We want to create a cube of length L=10m, height H=1m and width l=1m with a cylinder of radius R=0.4m at one meter from the left side of the cube. So the center of the cylinder is located at the point $x=xomin+L/10$, $y=yomin+H/2$ with $(xomin, yomin, zomin)$ the origin of the frame.
\item Set these values in the window "maillagedefaut":
\begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Add the declaration of the parameter "radius" in the first line of the "maillagedefaut" file.
    \item [$\circ$] Set the values $xomin=0$, $xomax=10$, $yomin=0$, $yomax=2$, $zomin=0$ and $zomax=1$.
    \item [$\circ$] Add the initialization of the radius: $radius=0.4$.

In this exercise, you will learn how to create a 2D mesh with Xprepro. 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{PICTURES/xprepro.pdf}

\end{figure}

The radius of the cylinders is 0.2m and the distances between cylinders are 0.2m in the y direction and 0.6m in the x direction. \\
%You will have a look at the "virus" example (button Examples) to see how to build a loop in the viewlist.

\begin{itemize}
\item Create a directory: Run Xprepro in the TRUST environment:\\
\textbf{mkdir \, -p \, Formation\_TRUST/yourname/Xprepro/exo2} \\
\textbf{cd \, Formation\_TRUST/yourname/Xprepro/exo2} \\

\begin{itemize}
\item First, have a look at the "Examples..." ("Picture" button and if you are interested by one "Copy and Read" button).
%\item First, have a look at the Examples (Copy and Read button on virus example) to understand how you will use fortran code in the viewlist to create loops for building your cylinders.

\item Then, click on the button "Default" to define the initial block and edit the dimensions file. 
\item Note that the files "maillagedefaut" and "defaut.prep" are saved in your directory (with "save" in nedit for "maillagedefaut" and "Save file prepro" in Xprepro for defaut.prep).

\item It is a 2D geometry, so we will define:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] xomin=0.,
    \item [$\circ$] xomax=10.,
    \item [$\circ$] yomin=0.,
    \item [$\circ$] yomax=2.,

    \item [$\circ$] zomax=0.01.,
    \item [$\circ$] eps=0.0001 (tolerance) and
    \item [$\circ$] radius=0.2 (don't forget to declare it).

\begin{itemize}
\item Click "Modify" on the viewlist to modify the nodes number NX=203, NY=43, NZ=4.
\item Set the matter index to 1000, line 5.
\item Build the boundary blocks:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] line 7, change the "back boundary" name to \textbf{lateral}, INDMAT=$0$,
    \item [$\circ$] line 8, change the "front boundary" name to \textbf{""}, INDMAT=$0$,
    \item [$\circ$] line 9, change the "left boundary" name to \textbf{inlet}, INDMAT=$-1000$,
    \item [$\circ$] line 10, change the "right boundary" name to \textbf{outlet}, INDMAT=$-2000$,
    \item [$\circ$] line 11, change the "bottom boundary" name to \textbf{""}, INDMAT=$0$,
    \item [$\circ$] line 12, change the "top boundary" name to \textbf{""}, INDMAT=$0$.
    \end{itemize}

\item The coordinates of the center of the first cylinder, which after will be duplicated, are (x0, y0)=(0.6, 0.4). So the distance between two cylinder center is $dx=0.8$ and $dy=0.3$. Declare and initialize these parameters $(x0, y0, dx, dy)$ in your "maillagedefaut" file.

\item Think about how to create 2 Fortran nesteed loops to copy the first cylinder in the two directions X and Y.

\item Create them with the button "Add", select "(fortran code)" instead of "$\square$" and write your loops in fortran.
\item Check the other objects in the viewlist and save your work with the button "Save file" prepro then check the name of the boundaries with "Boundaries information".
\item Run the model with "Modeling run...". A window is opened where you will check the nodes coordinates of the mesh.
\item Click on "Pre-mesh visualization" to check your pre-mesh.

\item Create a 2D cut slice in the XY plane: with "Add" button, choose an object of "Meshing creation 2D" type and name it coupe\_2D. Set $POS=0$, $IDIR=3$, $INDMAT=-5000$.
\item Click "Modeling run..." then "Pre-mesh visualization".
\item Warning, it is always a 3D model in Xprepro, even if you wish a 2D mesh. By default, you see the indexes between 1000 and -3000. If you don't see the cylinders, create a 2D slice in the XY plane in VisIt to see inside the 3D pre-mesh.

    \item [$\circ$] "debit4" correspond to "std" test case with zero initial velocity and imposed flow rate to $2 m^3/s$ on "periox" boundary.
    \item [$\circ$] Add a line in the "prepare" file using the "sed" command to create the new data file like the other ones:\\
    \textbf{nedit src/prepare \& }
    \end{itemize}

\item We are going to update the validation form.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Modify the "Canal.prm" file in "src" directory to take into account the new test case debit4. Add in the \textbf{Parameters} block :\\
    \hspace{0.3cm} \textbf{TestCase . Debit4.data}\\

    \item [$\circ$] Build the report by running the 4 test cases simultaneously (not sequentially):\\
    \textbf{Run\_fiche\index{Run\_fiche} -parallel\_run -xpdf}
    \item [$\circ$] You can add the results of this test case to your "visu" and "table".
    \end{itemize}
