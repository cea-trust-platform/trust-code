\item On CEA Saclay PCs, TRUST versions are available with:\\
\textbf{source  /home/trust\_trio-public/env\_TRUST-1.9.5.sh}

Ensure that the configuration is ok and locate the sources:\\

\item We want to change the inheritance of the class in order that it inherits from "Interprete\_geometrique\_base" class
instead of "Objet\_U".

"Interprete\_geometrique\_base" class is the base class of all the keywords doing tasks on domains (eg: Mailler, Lire\_fichier,...).\\
\vspace{0.1cm}
So:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] add an "\#include <Interprete\_geometrique\_base.h>" in my\_first\_class.h,
    \item [$\circ$] replace "Objet\_U" to "Interprete\_geometrique\_base" in the .h and .cpp files,
    \item [$\circ$] Interprete\_geometrique\_base contains a pure virtual method which you should implement\\
    \item [$\circ$] rebuild your application and an error will occur!
    \end{itemize}

This error indicates that a pure virtual function ("interpreter\_") should be implemented.

\item Look at the "Interprete\_geometrique\_base" class:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] in Eclipse: highlight the string "Interprete\_geometrique\_base" and push the F3 button of your keyboard to open the declaration file of this class

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Create a new cpp class}

\begin{itemize}
\item Look at "interpreter()" method, which calls the "interpreter\_()" method. \\
 This method is called each time a keyword is read in the data file (eg: "Read\_file dom dom.geom", "Solve pb",...).

\item Define the public method "interpreter\_(Entree\&)" in the include file and implement it
(just print a message with "Cerr" like "- My first keyword!") into the cpp file. \\
"Entree" is a TRUST class to read an input stream (from a file for example):\\
virtual Entree\& interpreter\_(Entree\&) override;

\item Rebuild your project and fix errors until the binary of your project is built

\item Remember the "equation" or "problem" UML diagram of the presentation's slides.

\item Look for help inside the "Domaine\_VF", "Probleme\_base" and "Domaine\_dis\_base" into the HTML documentation to access to the:
    \begin{itemize}

%Loop in the Probleme\_base class on each equation -> Probleme\_base.cpp
%calculer()
%→ During the time step, perform the main task of the class
%mettre\_a\_jour()
%→ At the end of the time step (eg : update time field)
%Loop in the Probleme\_base class on each equation -> Probleme\_base.cpp
%postraiter()
%→ At the end of the time step, post process the fields into the result files
%Example : LES Turbulence model in Mod\_turb\_hyd\_ss\_maille.cpp
