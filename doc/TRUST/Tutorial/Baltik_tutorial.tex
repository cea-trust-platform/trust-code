    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] add an "\#include <Interprete\_geometrique\_base.h>" in my\_first\_class.h,
    \item [$\circ$] switch "Objet\_U" to "Interprete\_geometrique\_base" in the .h and .cpp files,
    \item [$\circ$] rebuild your application.\\
    \item [$\circ$] An error will occur!
    \end{itemize}

\item You will have an error indicating a pure virtual function ("interpreter\_") should be implemented.

\item Look at the "Interprete\_geometrique\_base" class:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Eclipse: highlight the string "Interprete\_geometrique\_base" and push the F3 button of your keyboard to open the declaration file of this class
    \item [$\circ$] Or with the HTLM documentation: open the declaration file of the "Interprete\_geometrique\_base" class

\item Notice the "interpreter()" method (which calls the "interpreter\_()" method).

\item This method is called each time a keyword is read in the data file (eg: "Read\_file dom dom.geom", "Solve pb",...).

(just print a message with "Cerr" like "- My first keyword!") into the cpp file. 

\item "Entree" is a TRUST class to read an input stream (from a file for example):\\

\begin{block}{Part 1}

\begin{itemize}
\item To call it in the data file, you have to use the following syntaxe as the read of the parameters is done by the readOn method:
\begin{center}
\fbox{ \begin{minipage}[c]{0.9\textwidth}
\begin{alltt}
{\bf{A}} a\\
{\bf{Read}} a \{ {\bf{dimension}} 3 {\bf{option}} fast \}
\end{alltt}
\end{minipage}}
\end{center}

\item In our case, the read of the parameters will be done by the interpreter() method so the syntax in the data file will be the following:
\begin{center}
\fbox{ \begin{minipage}[c]{0.9\textwidth}
\begin{alltt}
{\bf{my\_first\_class}} \{ {\bf{domaine}} dom {\bf{option}} 0 \} \\
\textcolor{blue}{\# dom is the domain name \#}
\end{alltt}
\end{minipage}}
\end{center}

\item Add into the "interpreter\_(Entree\&)" method the read of these parameters into braces using the \textbf{Param} object.

\item \textbf{Param} use is the recommended choice in this case (even though many current TRUST classes are still using the old fashion to read parameters), because it
greatly simplifies the coding.

\item Now we want to obtain the problem object using his name. You can have a look at the following method: \\
Interprete\_geometrique\_base::associer\_domaine ( Nom \& nom\_dom)

\item Look the HTML documentation. What is the task of this method?

\item Once implementation is finished, add a check at the end of the method
"interpreter\_(Entree\&)" and find how to print the domain name:
\begin{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item We are going to try to print information of the domain boundaries in our current project.

\item Edit the "my\_first\_class.cpp" file and add into the "interpreter\_()" method a loop on the boundaries.

\item Look for help inside the "Domaine", "Zone", "Bord", "Frontiere" classes into the HTML documentation to access to the:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Number of boundaries (\textbf{nb\_bords()} method)

\begin{itemize}
\item The information is in the "Zone\_VF" class (a "Zone\_dis" discretized zone) which can't be accessed 
from the domain, only from the problem. 

\item So we need to read another parameter in our data file:\\
\begin{center}

{\bf{my\_first\_class}} \{ {\bf{domaine}} dom {\bf{option}} 0 {\bf{problem}} pb \}

\item Then, remember the "equation" or "problem" UML diagram of the presentation's slides.

\item Look for help inside the "Zone\_VF", "Probleme\_base" and "Equation\_base" into the HTML documentation to access to the:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] equation (\textbf{equation(int)} method)
    \item [$\circ$] discretized zone (\textbf{zone\_dis()} method)
    \item [$\circ$] control volumes (\textbf{volumes\_entrelaces()} method)

\begin{itemize}
\item You will need to cast the discretized zone returned by the \textbf{zone\_dis()} method into a "Zone\_VF" object.

\item You will print the size of the control volumes array with something like:
\begin{center}

\begin{alltt}
{\bf{Cerr}} <\textcompwordmark{}< control\_volumes.size() <\textcompwordmark{}< {\bf{finl}};

\item Where control\_volumes is a \textbf{DoubleVect} returned by the \textbf{Zone\_VF::volumes\_entrelaces()} method.
\item If you look at the "Problem" UML diagram of the presentation's slides, you will notice a better path to access to the discretized zone.
\item What is this path ?
\item Now, compute and print the sum of the control volumes with a "for" loop.

%Terminology/chronology of methods in TRUST
%interpreter()/readOn()
%→ The parameters of the keyword are read
%associer()
%→ Called by a Associate keyword, generally to fill the references (pointer) to other objects (eg : link to an Equation)
%discretiser()
%→ Called by Discretize keyword, complete tasks related to the selected discretization (eg : discretize a field)
%completer()
%→ All the data file is read, and some initializations are completed now
%Loop in the Probleme\_base class on each equation -> Probleme\_base.cpp
%Loop in Equation\_base class on each operator, discretized boundary condition, sources and time sheme -> Equation\_base.cpp
%preparer\_calcul()
%→ Before the first time step (eg : initialize arrays, set time to 0)
%Loop in the Probleme\_base class on each equation -> Probleme\_base.cpp
%calculer()
%→ During the time step, perform the main task of the class
%mettre\_a\_jour()
%→ At the end of the time step (eg : update time field)
%Loop in the Probleme\_base class on each equation -> Probleme\_base.cpp
%postraiter()
%→ At the end of the time step, post process the fields into the result files
