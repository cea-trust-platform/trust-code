\begin{block}{Code coupling ... what for ?}

\begin{columns}[c] 
\column{.6\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}
\item Traditionnaly \textit{numerical simulation codes} focus on a single physics
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] One code for thermics
    \item [$\circ$] Another code for mechanics,
    \item [$\circ$] Etc...
    \end{itemize}
\item Real life studies require the simulation of different physics
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] E.g. nuclear reactor simulations require a blend of: thermics, neutronics, mechanics...
    \end{itemize}
\item Solution? Code coupling!
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Have different codes communicating one with another...
    \item [$\circ$] while each code deals with its own area of expertise
    \end{itemize}

\frametitle{Code coupling}
\begin{block}{First approach}

\begin{itemize}
\item An entity driving the complete computation is needed: the \textbf{\textcolor{LightSkyBlue}{supervisor}}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Initializes code A and code B
    \item [$\circ$] Loop through code A and code B
    \item [$\circ$] Centralize exchanges and conversions between A and B
\end{itemize}
Supervisor is usually written from scratch as a C++ program, Python script, $\cdots$

\item In a dummy approach : supervisor needs to know \textit{both} A and B API. \\
It becomes cumbersome if :
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] more than 2 codes to couple ...
    \item [$\circ$] single supervisor is meant to run with different pairs of codes (code C, D, E ...)
    \end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Better: common interface!}


\underline{\textbf{Idea}}: define a unique \textit{interface} to which each code must comply
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Only an \textit{interface}, i.e. a contract (=an API) that each code fulfills
    \item [$\circ$] \textit{Implementation} (=plugging wires) of this interface is tightly linked to the details of the code...
    \end{itemize}
Advantages:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] All codes implementing the (unique) interface can be passed to the supervisor (almost) without modifying it! \textbf{\textcolor{LightSkyBlue}{Versatility}}
    \end{itemize}
Constraints:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Need to implement the interface for each code to be coupled

ICoCo is such a coupling interface:
\begin{itemize}
\item Stands for \textbf{I}nterface for \textbf{Co}de \textbf{Co}upling
\item Written in C++ (and in swig since TRUST-1.8.3 to be used through Python)
\vspace{0.2cm}
\item Initially designed for simulation codes exhibiting \textbf{\textcolor{LightSkyBlue}{iterative time loops}} 
\vspace{0.2cm}
\item Presents a set of standard methods whose signature is fixed, with no default implementation:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] initializeTimeStep()
    \item [$\circ$] validateTimeStep()
    \item [$\circ$] abortTimeStep()
    \item [$\circ$] ...
    \end{itemize}
\item Uses the notion of field for data exchange between codes
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] A field is a set of values supported by a mesh
    \item [$\circ$] A possible implementation: \textbf{MEDCouplingFieldDouble}, from SALOME's MEDCoupling library

\begin{block}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item Before starting this Tutorial, \\
 it is highly recommended to know some TRUST commands and hints.\vspace{0.2cm}
 \item Source the TRUST environment:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item On CEA Saclay PCs, TRUST versions are available with (e.g. X.Y.Z=1.8.3):\\
\textbf{source /home/triou/env\_TRUST\_X.Y.Z.sh}
\vspace{0.2cm}
\item On your own computer, download and install the latest version of TRUST in your local folder \$MyPathToTRUSTversion (unless this was already performed), then write on the terminal:\\
%\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{source  \$MyPathToTRUSTversion/env\_TRUST.sh}
\vspace{0.2cm}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\item Source the ICoCo environment:\\
\hspace{-0.5cm}\texttt{\$ source \$TRUST\_ROOT/Outils/ICoCo/ICoCo\_src/full\_env\_MEDICoCo.sh}

\item check if ICoCo is compiled:\\
\texttt{\$ ls \$exec} 

\item If you obtain "ls: cannot access **/Outils/ICoCo/ICoCo\_src/ICoCo\_opt: No such file or directory", then compile ICoCo\_src:\\
\texttt{\$ cd \$TRUST\_ROOT/Outils/ICoCo/ICoCo\_src}\\
\texttt{\$ baltik\_build\_configure -execute}\\
\texttt{\$ make optim debug }\\
\texttt{\$ source full\_env\_MEDICoCo.sh}

\texttt{\$ mkdir -p ICoCo}\\
\texttt{\$ cp -r \$TRUST\_ROOT/Outils/ICoCo/ICoCo\_src ICoCo/ICoCo\_src}\\

\begin{block}{}
The idea here is to:

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Create a reference test case 
\begin{itemize}
\item To be launched with TRUST executable.
\end{itemize}\vspace{0.1cm}
\item Update the test case in order to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Launch it sequentially with ICoCo without information exchange.
\item  Ensure that obtained results are identical to those obtained in step 1.
\end{itemize}\vspace{0.1cm}
\item Realize your first information exchange between the supervisor and datafile
\begin{itemize}
\item Impose a boundary condition from the supervisor and launch the calculation sequentially with ICoCo
\item Compare the results with those obtained with TRUST executable.
\end{itemize}\vspace{0.1cm}
\item Make the test case running with ICoCo in parallel:
\begin{itemize}
\item Launch the computation with ICoCo on 2 processes \item Compare obtained results with those with TRUST executable.

\begin{itemize}
\item Open the main.cpp file and search for the MPI command lines.
\item Open this file and look where:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] the processors are added: search for "dom\_ids"
    \item [$\circ$] the names of the datafiles: search for "data\_file"
    \end{itemize}

\item Create the makefile and coompile your new file:\\
\texttt{\$ sh create\_Makefile}\\
\texttt{\$ make}\\
\item To run parallel, you have to use the following mpirun command:\\
\texttt{\$ mpirun -np 2 ./couplage}\\

\item Compare your results with the sequential ones:\\
\texttt{\$ compare\_lata PAR\_Vahl\_Davis\_hexa\_ICoCo\_para.lml ../Vahl\_Davis\_hexa\_exchange/Vahl\_Davis\_hexa\_exchage.lml}\\

\frametitle{Goal of this second exercise}
\begin{block}{}
The idea here is to:

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Create a reference test case treating a coupled problem 
\begin{itemize}
\item To be launched with TRUST executable in sequential and parallel.
\end{itemize}\vspace{0.1cm}
\item Create two datafiles, each one for a problem:
\begin{itemize} 
\item Launch it with TRUST first to ensure that datafiles do not contain errors
\item Launch it with ICoCo without any information exchange after updating datafiles.
\end{itemize}\vspace{0.1cm}
\item Realize a one way coupling with ICoCo:
\begin{itemize}
\item One way coupling means that one problem runs alone while some inputs of the second problem are provided by the first one 
\item Launch the calculation sequentially with ICoCo
\item Compare the results with those obtained with TRUST executable.
\end{itemize}\vspace{0.1cm}
\item Realize a two-way coupling with ICoCo:
\begin{itemize}
\item Two-way means that each problem will have inputs provided by the other one.
\item Launch the computation with ICoCo.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

be sure that you forget a step during the compilation of your baltik (or TrioCFD) project. You can do:\\

\begin{frame}{Using ICoCo API through Python}

\begin{block}{}
In addition to the MEDCoupling python API, it is possible since TRUST-1.8.3 to:
\begin{itemize}
\item use ICoCo API from python scripts
\item exploit multiple processors from python thanks to mpi4py package
\end{itemize}
These new features can be used by loading a specific environment file: \\
\texttt{> source \$TRUST\_ROOT/env\_for\_python.sh} \\
\texttt{> python} \\
\texttt{  > import trusticoco as ti }\\
\texttt{  > import medcoupling as mc}\\
\texttt{  > from mpi4py import MPI}


If you are interested in such coupling, you can copy the following test case from TRUST tests database:\\
\texttt{> source \$TRUST\_ROOT/env\_for\_python.sh} \\
\texttt{> trust -copy docond\_VEF\_3D\_ICoCo\_py} \\
and have a look at its prepare script.

\begin{frame}{Conclusions and further simulations!}

\begin{block}{Conclusion}
This tutorial gave you an idea on how to run TRUST test cases with:
\begin{itemize}
\item no exchange by ICoCo
\item imposing values from ICoCo as boundary conditions in TRUST datafile
\item exchanging values between two datafiles where coupling is realised with ICoCo
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{}
We have seen also how to run TrioCFD cases with ICoCo without any exchange, but we beleive you are able to perform exchange in ICoCo with TrioCFD datafiles easily.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{}
Finally, we recall that it is possible for you since TRUST 1.8.3 to run ICoCo API from Python.
