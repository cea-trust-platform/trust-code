TODO once TRIOXDATA is dead:
* better formatting of XD tags (support multi-lines)
* revert to default ordering of attributes? inherited first, then the rest
    * WTF 'ef' / 'convection_ef' both syno 'ef' -> see commments/method in base.GetOneClassFromSyno() 
    * WTF2: GetAttributeList: I have to put members from base class after the ones from current class!! Not logical. perte_charge_reguliere / longitudinale needs this...
